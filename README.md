# 🧥 Invisible Cloak using OpenCV

This project creates a real-life **"invisibility cloak"** effect using Python and OpenCV, inspired by the invisibility cloak from the Harry Potter universe. It works by masking a specific color (like red) and replacing it with a static background frame, giving the illusion of invisibility.
